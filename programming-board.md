# Programming Board
One idea that works well for programming is setting up a "programming board" that has just enough hardware on it so a programmer can develop code and see that it turns motors, servos, and responds to sensors. Here's the hardware needed for a programming board:
- [Controller](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1595/)
- [Color sensor](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1557/)
- [touch sensor](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1425/)
- [2 M distance sensor](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1505/)
- [12V battery](https://www.servocity.com/matrix-12v-3000mah-nimh-battery/)
- [12V battery charger](https://www.servocity.com/12v-nimh-nicad-smart-battery-charger-with-tamiya-connector/)
- [XT30 to Tamia power adapter](https://www.servocity.com/xt30-to-tamiya-adaptor/)
- [servo](https://www.servocity.com/2000-series-dual-mode-servo-25-2/)
- [motor](https://www.servocity.com/5202-series-yellow-jacket-planetary-gear-motor-26-9-1-ratio-223-rpm-3-3-5v-encoder/)
- [power adapter from controller to motor](https://www.servocity.com/2-pin-jst-vh-to-3-5-mm-female-bullet-adaptor/)
- [encoder adapter from controller to motor](https://www.servocity.com/4-pos-jst-ph-mh-fc-to-4-pos-jst-xh-mh-fc-adaptor-300mm-length/)
- (need 3, so qty 2 of this) [3-pin JST connectors for the I2C sensors](https://www.revrobotics.com/jst-ph-3-pin-communication-cable-2-pack/)

This can all be mounted on a wood/plastic/metal board or rails with screws & nuts.  The programming connection is wireless, using a WiFi Direct link between the laptop and the controller.
