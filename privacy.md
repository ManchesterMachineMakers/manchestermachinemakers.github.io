# Privacy Policy
This is the Privacy Policy for the Manchester Machine Makers' website and any subordinate websites, such as the blog.

**TL;DR:** We don't collect personal info, and we respect (unlike most people) Do-Not-Track and [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org).

This describes:
- [What we collect](#what)
- [How we collect it](#how)
- [Where and how your data is stored](#where)
- [How to prevent us from collecting it](#stopitnow)

## What We Collect {#what}
Whenever you visit a page on our website, we collect:
- What page you visited
- Your IP address (although that doesn't seem to work yet)
- Where you came from (although I'm not sure if that works yet either)
- What browser and operating system you are using, in the form of a [User-Agent string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent) (although it is [very convoluted](https://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/))
- When you visited

## How We Collect It {#how}
We use a custom service, named [Litelytics](https://github.com/aleksrutins/litelytics). When your browser visits one of our pages, a small script runs that sends an HTTP request to our instance of Litelytics, hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app), in San Francisco, California.

## Where It Is Stored {#where}
Your data is stored in a database on Railway. Your data may be transferred outside of your country or state of residence.

## How To Prevent Us From Collecting Your Data {#stopitnow}
To prevent us from collecting data, set a [Do-Not-Track](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track) or [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) header in your browser. [Brave](https://brave.com) and a couple other browsers set at least one by default. Most browsers also have an option in their settings. Another way to enable it is through an extension such as [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/app).
