# Open Source
We love open source! At least, I do. Here are our projects:
- [EasyOp](https://manchestermachinemakers.github.io/easyop): A library for more easily writing FTC opmodes.
- [Redbot](https://github.com/ManchesterMachineMakers/redbot): (DISCONTINUED) Ruby for FTC!
- [FTCBuild](https://github.com/ManchesterMachineMakers/FTCBuild): A Windows Project Reunion app for building FTC projects.
- [Litelytics](https://github.com/aleksrutins/litelytics): An open-source self-hosted web analytics tool.
