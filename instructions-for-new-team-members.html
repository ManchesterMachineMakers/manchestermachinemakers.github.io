<p>Here are the steps you and your parents/guardians need to take to become an official member of the <strong>Manchester Machine Makers</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Every team member needs to register with 4-H
    <ul>
      <li>Go to <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/extension/youth/join-4-h">https://www.uvm.edu/extension/youth/join-4-h</a> and follow the link to register online.</li>
      <li>You can choose the Manchester Machine Makers in Bennington County as part of the process.  There will be a release form or two that you’ll need to fill out and have your parents/guardians sign, but it can all be done online.</li>
      <li>If you don’t want to use the online process, there’s information about offline registration on that same page.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Every team member needs to Register with FIRST
    <ul>
      <li>Go to <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system">https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system</a> and click the “Complete Registration Now” button.   When it asks for the team name/number that you’re wishing to join, we are the Manchester Machine Makers, FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) team # 16221.</li>
      <li>Once you and your parents have completed the application, the coaches will be notified.  You’ll get a confirmation email back when your application has been accepted.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, you will need to join the team’s Slack channel, ftc-manchestervt.slack.com, since this is one of the team’s primary communication channels.    If you wish, you can also join the Vermont FTC Discord and Vermont FTC Slack channel (vermont-ftc.slack.com).  (You’ll need invitations for these.)</p>

<!--The Manchester Machine Makers website at https://manchestermachinemakers.github.io has basic information about the team’s activities.  You can also find out more about the types of tools that team’s members use, including mechanical tools, CAD software, simulation software, programming tools, and more.   Don’t worry, the team’s sponsors provide these tools so they’re available to all team’s student members. (Let’s add a page of Tools We Use to the website - hardware and software, and things like safety glasses, allen wrenches, that sort of stuff).
